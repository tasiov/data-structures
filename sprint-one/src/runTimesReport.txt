Runtimes for Different Instantiation Types of Stacks and Queues

In this investigation, the following samples were created for each instantiation type: 

# of stacks = 2000, each stack contained 2000 entries

# of queues = 2000, each queue contained 2000 entries

Results: 

  Functional
    Stack: 1073 ms
    Queue: 1078 ms

  Functional-shared
    Stack: 1017 ms
    Queue: 1108 ms

  Prototypal
    Stack: 762 ms
    Queue: 1137 ms

  Psuedoclassical
    Stack: 728 ms
    Queue: 1104 ms

Comments:

  For each instantiation type, queues took longer than stacks to initialize and populate. The psuedoclassical instantiation sample had the shortest runtime and was marginally faster than the prototypal instantiation sample. The runtime for the stack samples was roughly 30% faster for the prototypal and psuedoclassical instantiation types versus functional and functional-shared instantiation types.
